# 3RD PARTY API

## CHALLENGES

1. **Priority Management**: Figuring out which features are worth the time and core to product. Keeping app within 2-3 weeks scope
2. **Focus**: Dedicating more time on one particular skill, specifically, JavaScript over other technologies. Therefore, for styling and other features, delegate it to other libraries or frameworks.
3. **Handling Both Backend and Frontend work**:

- Creating a backend API for the frontend was difficult, a lot new concepts had to be learned about Node and making sure that the backend and frontend can communicate well

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

1. _Add Marketplace_: Hook up with Udemy API or something where developers can buy courses inside the app
2. _Job Search_: Potentially add a job API from Greenhouse to allow users to find jobs in the platform
